  LIPS 3D camera/SDK offers a system for developing depth-sensing applications.
  As the LIPS system architecture illustrates, the system is comprised of the
  hardware layer and the software layer.

# 2. SDK Structure

The hardware layer oversees data capture, transfer, and processes.

In the software layer, the captured data is fetched by the LIPS SDK (Software Development Kit) on the OS environment. Depending on the project complexity, wrappers and third-party utilities may be engaged before the data is eventually presented in the application layer for business applications.

The core of the system, the LIPS SDK, is comparable to a toolbox full of software modules comprised of middleware, libraries, wrappers and API, and miscellaneous programming languages / platforms for application development. With extensive wrapper support, LIPS SDK enables developers to access bottom layer data with APIs, thus eliminating the hassle of changing third-party functions. The result is a highly effective project scoping, monitoring and execution workflow compatible with the fast-pacing AIoT market and machine vision demands.
